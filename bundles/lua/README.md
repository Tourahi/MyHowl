# Lua bundle

## What is it?

This bundle contains support for the [Lua](http://www.lua.org) language. In
addition to the ordinary support for syntax highlighting, indentation, etc.,
this bundle also ships with bundled API documentation (Lua 5.1, for
`show-doc-at-cursor`) and bundles the
[luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) analysis tool for builtin
inspection support.
